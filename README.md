# Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++

This is an educational project that implements a Binary Search Tree using C++.
AVL Tree insertion added (self-balancing with rotations).

## Features
- Insert nodes
- Search values
- Delete nodes:
  - Leaf node
  - Node with one child
  - Node with two children (using inorder successor)

## Concepts Practiced
- Recursion
- Pointers
- Dynamic memory management
- Data Structures (Trees)

## Purpose
This project was built for learning purposes to better understand recursion
and tree data structures.
